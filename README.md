# Tic Tac Toe with AI
This is a project from [hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/projects/81?track=1)

Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game 
from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as 
Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. 
A single mistake usually costs you the game, 
but thankfully it is simple enough that most 
players discover the best strategy quickly. 
Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

To play enter in command line:

```java -jar target/tic-tac-toe-with-ai-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar```

You'll be prompted to input command in the following format:

```start x-player o-player```  or
```exit```

where x-player and o-player can be:

- user - human player,
- easy - ai that makes random moves
- medium - slightly harder to beat ai
- hard - ai that moves based on minimax algorithm

At each stage you enter coordinates of the move (y and x):

(1 1) (1 2) (1 3)

(2 1) (2 2) (2 3)

(3 1) (3 2) (3 3)
